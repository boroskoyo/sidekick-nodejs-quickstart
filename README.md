```sh
  Make sure docker daemon is running.
  ```
* npm
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
* Visual Studio Code

### Installation

_Below is an example of how you can instruct your audience on installing and setting up your app. This template doesn't rely on any external dependencies or services._

#### Running Sidekick with default settings
1. Clone the Sidekick repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/runsidekick/sidekick.git
   ```
2. Go to the docker folder under the project
3. Run command `docker-compose up -d` and wait for a minute
    - App is ready

#### Running Quickstart Project
